      "description": "**What is Lilase?**\nA 1.8.9 Forge mod, that automatically buy items from Auction House to flip (sell for a higher price) them.\n\n**What is Cofl and why is it better to buy it?**\nA search engine, on which Lilase depends. It finds all the flips (not only good), filters them and sends to the client (you). Then Lilase parses what COFL sent, and buyes given items.\n\n**What is GodFlipper?**\nIt's a config for COFL. You need it to not waste your money on bad things (like vanilla items). Note that you must use it, if you are not ready to lose all the money.\n\n**Does Lilase have \"skip\" in the cofl macro?**\nYes\n\n**What is Bed spam & Delay?**\nBed spam & Delay is for auctions that has just started that have the bed item in the GUI to buy\n\n**The sniper isn't buying items/Listing them:**\nMake sure its actually on (Press M key/rebind in settings), and make sure sniper only is off. Keep in mind, the mod only works in Hub at the moment.\nIf you tried both and it isn't working, ping Night with logs\n**Donâ€™t use any clients except pure forge other mods at the same time except COFL, Lilase and essentials(not required but you can)**\n\n**Is there a paid version of Lilase:**\nYes, it will include bug fixes from Lilase and better features. Open a ticket to buy it in the server. Also donations recommended. \n[Night's paypal](https://paypal.me/night0721)\n\n**Can I suggest features to add?**\nFeatures can be suggested but make sure they aren't features that already exist\n\n**I'm not getting webhook messages:**\nMake sure you put the correct URL in config properly, or try again by directly edit Lilase.json in config folder, any URL not starting with https:// **will not work**\n\n**Will Lilase be able to macro other things in game?**\nAt the moment no but that doesn't mean I won't test on other macros such as one for bazzar\n\n**What is required to run this?**\n[Forge 1.8.9](https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html), [COFL](https://github.com/Coflnet/SkyblockMod/releases/latest) and [Lilase](https://github.com/night0721/Lilase/releases/latest)\n\n**Is Lilase open source:**\nYes, it is and located [here](https://github.com/night0721/Lilase)\n\n**What is Webhook?**\nYou get send notifications, when Lilase buys/sells items. It's done through Discord's webhooks, here is the tutorial to create one of those: [Click here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fKksxz2Gdnc)\n\nUseful Links:\n**[COFL](https://sky.coflnet.com/flipper?refId=oedm8r)**\n**[COFL Premium Link](https://sky.coflnet.com/premium?refId=oedm8r)**\n**[Macro Showcase Video](https://youtu.be/HqYhtSoDGBc)**\n**[COFL Config](https://discord.gg/godflipper)**\n**[How to use the mod?](https://github.com/night0721/Lilase#download)**\n**[How to get logs?](https://github.com/night0721/Lilase#how-to-get-logs)**\n**[How to use remote control](https://github.com/night0721/Lilase#remote-control)**\n\n**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER:**\nMove your important items to chest before starting the mod to prevent any incidents to happen",
